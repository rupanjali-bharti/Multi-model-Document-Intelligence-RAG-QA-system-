## 📚 Multi-Modal RAG for Complex Financial & Policy Documents

This repository presents a **Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** designed to answer questions from real-world, information-rich documents such as **IMF Article IV reports**, policy papers, and financial disclosures.

Unlike traditional text-only QA pipelines, this system processes and reasons over **multiple document modalities**, including:

* 📄 Narrative text
* 📊 Tables and structured data
* 📈 Charts and figures
* 🖼️ Scanned images and visual elements
* 📝 Footnotes and references

By combining **multi-modal document parsing**, **vector-based retrieval**, and **large language models**, the system ensures that critical insights embedded in non-textual components are not missed.

### 🔍 Key Features

* Multi-modal document ingestion (PDFs with text, tables, images)
* Intelligent chunking and embedding across modalities
* Vector database–powered retrieval for relevant context
* LLM-based answer generation grounded in retrieved evidence
* Source attribution for transparency and trust
* Designed for financial, economic, and policy analysis use cases

### 🚀 Use Cases

* Question answering on IMF, World Bank, and policy reports
* Financial analysis and economic research
* Regulatory and compliance document understanding
* Enterprise knowledge retrieval from complex PDFs

This project demonstrates how **modern LLM applications can move beyond plain text** to deliver accurate, context-aware answers from real-world documents.
